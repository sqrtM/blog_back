# blog_back
backend for my little blog; frontend here: https://github.com/sqrtM/blog_vite.

this is the start of what will soon enough be my personal blog and professional portfolio. this was originally based on the models in Matt Raible's Spring tutorial here : https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/06/17/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot. it was a great first step into that framework.
I'm taking the models from there and mutating them into an API for a basic blog which can do all the CRUD operations as well as maintain CORs safety. very cool.
